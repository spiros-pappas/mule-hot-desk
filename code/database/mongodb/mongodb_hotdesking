For storing office plans we use MongoDB Atlas cloud service. This is an easy way to host and manage data. 
For this purpose, a new project "Smart Hotdesking" has been created within the organization Devoteam. Also, for this project new cluster is created and deployed with AWS as a provider inside of us-east-1 region. There is no any access limitation for connecting to cluster, so connection is allowed from any IP address.

This project has only one database, hotdesking, and only one user hotdeskUser. The plan is to host office plan of each building inside of buildings collection.
